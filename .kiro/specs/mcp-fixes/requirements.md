# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) system in the Traffic Router AI Platform is experiencing critical issues that prevent proper communication between the MCP client and server. The system shows 404 routing errors, server connectivity problems, and inconsistent resource handling. This feature aims to fix these issues and ensure reliable MCP functionality for AI agent integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the MCP server to start and run reliably, so that AI agents can communicate with the system through the MCP protocol.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is started THEN it SHALL listen on the configured port (3001) without errors
2. WHEN a health check request is made to /health THEN the server SHALL respond with status 200 and health information
3. WHEN the server encounters startup errors THEN it SHALL log detailed error messages and attempt graceful recovery
4. IF the server process crashes THEN it SHALL automatically restart within 5 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to access MCP resources through proper API endpoints, so that I can retrieve system information and perform operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/resources THEN the server SHALL return a list of available resources
2. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/resources/{resourceId} THEN the server SHALL return the specific resource content
3. WHEN an invalid resource is requested THEN the server SHALL return a 404 error with descriptive message
4. WHEN resource access fails THEN the server SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an MCP client, I want to call tools and execute operations through the MCP protocol, so that I can perform system management tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is made to /mcp/tools THEN the server SHALL return a list of available tools
2. WHEN a tool is called via /mcp/tools/call THEN the server SHALL execute the tool and return results
3. WHEN tool execution fails THEN the server SHALL return error details and maintain system stability
4. WHEN unauthorized tools are called THEN the server SHALL check auto-approve lists and handle appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging in the MCP system, so that I can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any MCP operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with timestamps
2. WHEN routing errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the requested path and method
3. WHEN server errors happen THEN the system SHALL provide stack traces in debug mode
4. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN it SHALL log successful recovery actions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the MCP client to properly connect to and communicate with MCP servers, so that the AI agent can function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP client starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to all enabled MCP servers
2. WHEN server connections fail THEN the client SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. WHEN servers become unavailable THEN the client SHALL detect disconnections and attempt reconnection
4. WHEN multiple servers are configured THEN the client SHALL manage connections to all servers independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want proper MCP server process management, so that the system remains stable and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is started THEN it SHALL register proper signal handlers for graceful shutdown
2. WHEN a shutdown signal is received THEN the server SHALL complete current operations before stopping
3. WHEN the server process exits unexpectedly THEN the process manager SHALL restart it automatically
4. WHEN server resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup and recovery
